Sozi is a zooming presentation editor and player.

Unlike in most presentation applications, a Sozi document is not organised as a slideshow,
but rather as a poster where the content of your presentation can be freely laid out.
Playing such a presentation consists in a series of translations, zooms and rotations
that allow to focus on the elements you want to show.

Sozi is based on open standards.
It is free software distributed according to the terms of the MIT license or GPL 3.0.
