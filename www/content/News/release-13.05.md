Summary:
    In January, I have published a preview release of Sozi with version number 13.01.
    Four months have passed, and I think the official release has been delayed long enough.

In January, I have published a [preview release of Sozi with version number 13.01](|filename|release-13.01.md).
Since then, I have been busy with other projects, including a trip to Ethiopia to adopt a 3-year-old child.
Four months have passed, and I think the official release has been delayed long enough.

So I am pleased to announce that Sozi 13.05 is available.
See the instructions to [download](|filename|/pages/en/download.md) and [install](|filename|/pages/en/install.md) it.

If you are already using Sozi 13.01, this new release does not add any new feature.
Translations have been updated for several languages.
Hyperlinks to Sozi frames should now work as expected in most browsers.

For developers and testers, the build system is now based on [SCons](http://www.scons.org/).
Building instructions are provided in the [README](https://github.com/senshu/Sozi/blob/master/README.md) file
at [the root of the source tree](https://github.com/senshu/Sozi).
