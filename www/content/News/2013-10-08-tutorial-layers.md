Support for layers has been added in Sozi 12.09 but for more than a year, I did not take the time to write a decent tutorial for this feature.
A video has been available on YouTube for some time, posted from an account that I have deleted since.
I will take care to put it online again soon.

So today, I am pleased to introduce the official [Sozi layers tutorial](|filename|/pages/en/tutorial-layers.md).

As you can see from the [Create](|filename|/pages/en/create.md) page, there is a long list of other topics announced
(most links lead to empty pages).
Which tutorial should I write next?
